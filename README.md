ImageBoardCrawler
============

Written for collecting original unlicensed photos for digitally-generated mosaics in Jython. Crawls the front page of an imageboard for a list of trigger-words, then grabs the meta-image that the trigger post was replying to. 




To Do
---
*   Argument input rather than setting values in the file.
*   Case insensitivity for full ascii range
*   Replace index selection with attribute selection in XPATHs
*   Detect purged threads
*   Utilize MD5 for when threads are purged mid-crawl
